Java Thread 
- An instance of class java.lang.Thread
- A thread of execution

Thread is just… an object 
A "thread of execution" is an individual process (a "lightweight" process) that has its own call stack. 
In Java, there is one thread per call stack—or, to think of it in reverse, one call stack per thread

- Can dumpStack() 
- The Thread class itself implements Runnable. (After all, it has a run()
method that we were overriding.) This means that you could pass a Thread to another Thread's constructor

- A thread is done being a thread when its target run() method completes.
- Once a thread has been started, it can never be started again.


The Thread Scheduler
	- The thread scheduler is the part of the JVM (although most JVMs map Java threads
	directly to native threads on the underlying OS) that decides which thread should
	run at any given moment, and also takes threads out of the run state

	- The order in which runnable threads are chosen to run is not guaranteed.
Some of the methods that can help us influence thread scheduling are as follows:

- From the java.lang.Thread Class
public static void sleep(long millis) throws InterruptedException
public static void yield()
public final void join() throws InterruptedException
public final void setPriority(int newPriority)

- Methods from the java.lang.Object Class 
public final void wait() throws InterruptedException
public final void notify()
public final void notifyAll()

Thread States and Transitions
	
New: not alive.
	-> 	 Thread instance has been created but the start() method has not been invoked on the thread
	->  It is a live Thread object, but not yet a thread of execution
	
Runnable: alive
	-> 	This is the state a thread is in when it's eligible to run but the
		scheduler has not selected it to be the running thread.
	-> A thread first enters the runnable state when the start() method is invoked, but a thread can
		also return to the runnable state after either running or coming back from a
	blocked, waiting, or sleeping state. 
	
Running
	-> 	This is the state a thread is in when the thread scheduler selects it from the runnable pool to
		be the currently executing process. 
		
	-> A thread can transition out of a running state for several reasons, including because "the thread scheduler felt like it." 
	There are several ways to get to the runnable state, 
	but ONLY ONE way to get to the running state: 
	The scheduler chooses a thread from the runnable pool.	


Waiting/blocked/sleeping: alive
	- Thread method is static method, using instance variable(bad example).
	- They are defined to always affect the thread that's currently executing
	A Thread does not tell to another Thread to do something.
	- There is a method, suspend()/stop(), in the Thread class that lets one thread tell another
	to suspend, but the methods has been deprecated
	- Note also that a thread in a blocked state is still considered alive.
	
Dead : not alive
	-> A thread is considered dead when its run() method completes
	-> It may still be a viable Thread object, but it is no longer a separate thread of
	execution
	-> Once a thread is dead, it can never be brought back to life! 

Preventing Thread Execution
	Sleeping
		 When a thread encounters a sleep call, it must go to sleep for at
		least the specified number of milliseconds (unless it is interrupted before its wake-up
		time, in which case, it immediately throws the InterruptedException).
		
		- Just because a thread's sleep() expires and it wakes up, this does not
		mean it will return to running! 
		- must know that a sleep() time is not a guarantee that the thread will start running
		again as soon as the time expires and the thread wakes.
	
	Thread Priorities and yield( )
		- Threads always run with some priority, usually represented as a number between 1
		and 10 	
		
		- at any given time, the currently running thread usually will not have a priority that is lower than any of the threads
		in the pool. In most cases, the running thread will be of equal or greater priority than the
		highest-priority threads in the pool
		
		- Don't rely on thread priorities when designing your multithreaded application.
		Because thread-scheduling priority behavior is not guaranteed, use thread
		priorities as a way to improve the efficiency of your program, but just be sure
		your program doesn't depend on that behavior for correctness.
		
	Setting a Thread's Priority
	
The yield( ) Method
	
	What yield() is supposed to do is make the currently running
	thread head back to runnable to allow other threads of the same priority to get their
	turn.
		
	So the intention is to use yield() to promote graceful turn-taking among
	equal-priority threads. In reality, though, the yield() method isn't guaranteed to do
	what it claims, and even if yield() does cause a thread to step out of running and
	back to runnable, there's no guarantee the yielding thread won't just be chosen again over
	all the others!	
	A yield() won't ever cause a thread to go to the waiting/sleeping/ blocking
	state. At most, a yield() will cause a thread to go from running to runnable, but
	again, it might have no effect at all.
	
The join( ) Method
	The non-static join() method of class Thread lets one thread "join onto the
	end" of another thread
	If you have a thread B that can't do its work until another
	thread A has completed its work, then you want thread B to "join" thread A. This
	means that thread B will not become runnable until A has finished (and entered the
	dead state).
	
three ways a running thread could leave the running state:
A call to sleep()	
	Guaranteed to cause the current thread to stop
	executing for at least the specified sleep duration (although it might be
	interrupted before its specified time).

A call to yield()
	Not guaranteed to do much of anything, although typically,
	it will cause the currently running thread to move back to runnable so that a
	thread of the same priority can have a chance.	
	
A call to join()
	Guaranteed to cause the current thread to stop executing
	until the thread it joins with (in other words, the thread it calls join() on)
	completes, or if the thread it's trying to join with is not alive, the current
	thread won't need to back out.	
	
Besides those three, we also have the following scenarios in which a thread might
leave the running state:
	- A call to wait() on an object (we don't call wait() on a thread, as we'll see
	in a moment).
	- A thread can't acquire the lock on the object whose method code it's
	attempting to run.	
	- The thread scheduler can decide to move the current thread from running
	to runnable in order to give another thread a chance to run. No reason is
	needed—the thread scheduler can trade threads in and out whenever it likes.
	
Synchronization and Locks
	- Acquiring a lock for an object is also known as getting the lock, or
	locking the object, locking on the object, or synchronizing on the object	
	- also use the term monitor to refer to the object whose lock we're acquiring
	
	- Since there is only one lock per object, if one thread has picked up the lock, no
other thread can pick up the lock until the first thread releases (or returns) the lock.

	Only methods (or blocks) can be synchronized, not variables or classes
	Each object has just one lock
	If a thread goes to sleep, it holds any locks it has—it doesn't release them
	 
	 
	- when you synchronize a block of code, you
	specify which object's lock you want to use as the lock, so you could, for example,
	use some third-party object as the lock for this piece of code. That gives you the
	ability to have more than one lock for code synchronization within a single object.
Static Methods Be Synchronized
 	- It's that java.lang.Class instance whose lock is used to protect the static methods of
	the class (if they're synchronized)
	Class cl = Class.forName("MyClass");
	
What Happens If a Thread Can't Get the Lock?
	- Threads calling non-static synchronized methods in the same class will
only block each other if they're invoked using the same instance. 
	- Threads calling static synchronized methods in the same class will
always block each other—they all lock on the same Class instance.

So When Do I Need to Synchronize?
	Generally, any time more than one thread is accessing mutable (changeable)
	data, you synchronize to protect that data to make sure two threads aren't changing
	it at the same time (or that one isn't changing it at the same time the other is
	reading it, which is also confusing)
	
	-> SynchronizatiInDifferentInstanceAndClassImproperly.java
	-> SynchronizatiInDifferentInstanceImproperly.java
	
	- Remember that a static synchronized method and a non-static synchronized method will not block each other—they can run at the
	same time
	
	To simplify:
	Access to static fields should be done using static synchronized methods.
	Access to non-static fields should be done using non-static synchronized methods.
	-> SynchronizeRule.java
	non-static method -> access static field
	static method -> access non-static field
	
Thread Interaction
		wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() must be called from within a synchronized
	context! A thread can't invoke a wait or notify method on an object unless it owns that
	object's lock.

*** When the wait() method is invoked on an object, the thread executing
that code gives up its lock on the object immediately. 
However, when notify() is called, that doesn't mean the thread gives up its lock at that moment. If the thread is
still completing synchronized code, the lock is not released until the thread moves out
of synchronized code. So just because notify() is called, this doesn't mean the lock
becomes available at that moment.	
- you should never rely on a particular thread being notified in preference to another.

- There's also a possible situation called spontaneous wakeup that may exist in some situations—a
thread may wake up even though no code has called notify() or notifyAll()

ReentrantLock
- You can avoid livelock in this scenario by introducing a short random delay with Thread.sleep(int) any time you
fail to acquire both locks.

Locks
Condition
	- A Condition provides the equivalent of the traditional wait, notify, and
	notifyAll methods. 
	
	- One advantage of a Condition over the traditional wait/notify operations is that
	multiple Conditions can exist for each Lock

ReentrantReadWriteLock

Use collections from the java.util.concurrent package with a focus on the
advantages over and differences from the traditional java.util collections.

Copy-on-Write Collections
	- eliminate the need to implement synchronization or
	locking when manipulating a collection using multiple threads.
	- a CopyOnWriteArrayList will never modify its internal array of data.
	- Modifications to the collections (not the elements within) are expensive because
	the entire internal array must be duplicated for each modification
	- Any mutating methods called on a copy-on-write–based Iterator or ListIterator
	(such as add, set, or remove) will throw an UnsupportedOperationException.
	
	-  atomic variables, locks, synchronized code blocks, 
	or immutable (readonly) objects to make the objects referenced by a collection thread-safe.
	
Concurrent Collections
	- concurrently read and modified by multiple threads, but without the
	copy-on-write behavior seen in the copy-on-write collections	
	-  inconsistencies issue
	
Blocking Queues
	ArrayBlockingQueue
	LinkedBlockingDeque
	LinkedBlockingQueue
	
Special-Purpose Queues
	SynchronousQueue
	DelayQueue

CPU-Intensive vs. I/O-Intensive Tasks

Use the Parallel Fork/Join Framework
	- Sometimes, you don't have multiple tasks; instead, you have one really big task.
Divide and Conquer
	- When using the Fork-Join Framework, your tasks will be coded to decide how
	many levels of recursion (how many times to subdivide) are appropriate. 
	
	- "paint the fence"
	
ForkJoinPool
	- Any problem that can be recursively divided can be solved using Fork-Join
	Anytime you want to perform the same operation on a
	collection of elements (painting thousands of fence planks or initializing
	100,000,000 array elements), consider using Fork-Join.
	- Runtime.availableProcessors() method to determine the level of parallelism
	
ForkJoinTask
	- to represent the task that should be accomplished	
	This is different from other executor services that primarily used either Runnable or Callable
	- the following methods are important: compute(), fork(), and join()
	
	- With the Fork-Join Framework, each thread in the ForkJoinPool has a queue of
	the tasks it is working on; this is unlike most ExecutorService implementations
	that have a single shared task queue.
	- The fork() method places a ForkJoinTask in the current thread's task queue
	-  you can't call fork() unless you are within a ForkJoinTask that is being executed by a ForkJoinPool.
