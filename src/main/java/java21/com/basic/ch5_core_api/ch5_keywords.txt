Creating and Manipulating Strings
	The String Pool
	Literal
	initialize object by new
	
	Since a String is a sequence of characters
	Implement CharSequence
	
	
CONCATENATION
		Placing one String before the other String and combining them.
		- both operands are numeric, + means numeric addition
		- either operand is a String, + means concatenation.
		- is evaluated left to right
		* Use numeric addition if two numbers are involved

IMMUTABILITY
	an object that can't be changed its state once it's created
	There's no way to change the value of the state once it's set
	
	* make the instance variable FINAL so the compiler reminds you if you accidentally change.
	* immutable classes in Java are final, which prevents subclasses creation
	-> You wouldn't want a subclass adding mutable behavior.
	
	- concat() will return a new String
	
IMPORTANT STRING METHODS
	a sequence of characters and Java counts from 0 when indexed.
	- length()
	- charAt() throws exception(StringIndexOutOfBoundsException)
	- int indexOf(int ch)
	
	- indexOf(int ch, int fromIndex)
	- indexOf(String str)
	- indexOf(String str, int fromIndex)
	  * returns '1 when no match 	
	  
	 substring() 
	 substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex) -> exclude endIndex
	 	is the trickiest String method 
	 	* throws exception
	 toLowerCase()
	 toUpperCase()
	 
	 equals(Object obj)
	 equalsIgnoreCase(String str) -> convert the characters' case if needed
	 	- check two String objects contain exactly the same characters in the same order.
	 
	 boolean startsWith(String prefix)
	 boolean endsWith(String suffix)
	 	* Java is doing a case-sensitive check on the values provided
	 	
	 String replace(char oldChar, char newChar)
	 String replace(CharSequence target, CharSequence replacement)
	 	* does a simple search and replace on the string
	 	
	 boolean contains(CharSequence charSeq)
	 	The contains() method is a convenience method so you don't have to write str.indexOf(otherString) != -1.
	 	
	trim()	
	 	removing blank space from the beginning and/or end of a String
	 	In terms of the exam, whitespace consists of spaces along with the \t (tab) and \n (newline) and \r (carriage return)
	 
	from Java 11
		 strip(), same trim() but support Unicode
		 String stripLeading() remove whitespaces from beginning
		 String stripTrailing()	 remove whitespaces from ending
		 
	intern()
		 returns the value from the string pool if it is there.Otherwise, it adds the value to the string pool
		 
		 
Using the StringBuilder Class
	StringBuilder is not imutable
	reuses the same StringBuilder without creating an interim String each time
	
	MUTABILITY AND CHAINING
	-> the StringBuilder changes its own state and returns a reference to itself
	
	CREATING A STRINGBUILDER
		with capacity or default or with String
	
	IMPORTANT STRINGBUILDER METHODS
		charAt(), indexOf(), length(), and substring() same String
		substring()	returns a String
		append() add a String and returns a reference to the current StringBuilder
			-> There are more than 10 method signatures that look similar but that take different data types as parameters
		
		insert()
			adds characters to the StringBuilder at the requested index(precede current index) and returns a reference to the current StringBuilder
			delete()
			deleteCharAt()
		
		replace()
		reverse()
		toString()
		
	StringBuilder did not implement equals(). If you call equals() on two StringBuilder instances, it will check reference equality.

* If a class doesn't have an equals method, Java determines whether the references point to the same object

THE STRING POOL(intern pool)
	location in the Java virtual machine (JVM) that collects all these strings		 
	-> contains literal values and constants that appear in your program	
	Concatenation is just like calling a method and results in a new String
	
	The intern() method will use an object in the string pool
		if one is present. If the literal is not yet in the string pool, Java
		will add it at this time.
		
	* compile-time constant that automatically gets placed in the string pool
	
Understanding Java Arrays
	reference type, ordered list, allow contain duplicate
	
	create: type, size, arr symbol
	int[] nums = new int[3] ->all elements are set to the default value for that type.
	anonymous array -> you don't specify the type and size.
	
	can type the [] before or after the name
	MULTIPLE 'ARRAYS' IN DECLARATIONS -> bracket must be right after type.
	-> DeclareArrayStyle.java
	
	toString(): [Ljava.lang .String;@160bc7c0 -> L mean arrays, String is the ref type, 160bc7c0 is the hashcode
	
	From  Java 5 -> Arrays.toString(bugs) nicely
	
	ArrayStoreException.java
	
	USING AN ARRAY
		.length without curly bracket()
		 length does not consider what is in the array;
		 it only considers how many slots have been allocated.
		 
	SORTING
	String sorts in alphabetic order, and 1 sorts before 9.
	Numbers sort before letters, and uppercase sorts before lowercase.
	
	SEARCHING
		Arrays.binarySearch()
		Binary search rules
			Found -> return index.
			Not Found -> negate and subtract 1
						 where a match needs to be inserted to preserve sorted order
			Unsorted -> result un-predictable
			
	COMPARING
		negate number -> first is smaller than second
		zero -> equal
		positive -> first is greater than the second
		
		same length, same value in each spot in the same order -> 0
		all the elements same, the second has extra elem -> negative else positive
		first elem of first array are smaller -> negative else positive
		
		smaller means:
			null is smaller than any other value.
			for string numbers are smaller than letters
			uppercase is smaller than lowercase.
			
		mismatch()
			If the arrays are equal, mismatch() returns -1.
			Otherwise, it returns the first index where they differ
			
	VARARGS
		public static void main(String... args) // varargs
		
	
	MULTIDIMENSIONAL ARRAYS
		MultidimensionalArray.java
		asymmetric multidimensional array
		
	Understanding an ArrayList
		can change capacity at runtime
		an ordered sequence
		allows duplicates
		implement interface List
		
		required  diamond operator / no diamond will warning
		var list = new ArrayList<>(); -> type of var is objects
		
		
USING AN ARRAYLIST
	ArrayListWithoutGeneric.java
	
	boolean add(E element)
	void add(int index, E element)
	boolean remove(Object object)
	E remove(int index)  index that doesn't exist will throw an exception.
	E set(int index, E newElement) IndexOutOfBoundsException
	isEmpty() and size()
	clear()
	contains()
	equals() -> same element in same ordered
	
WRAPPER CLASSES
	 has a constructor(isn't recommended for new code)/use valueOf() instead of, it allows object caching.
	 wrapper classes are immutable and take advantage of some CACHING as well
	 XValue() -> revert (un-boxing)./parseValue -> NumberFormatException
	 Charactor has no method for boxing and unboxing.
	 
	 - it can be used to store a null value
	 
AUTOBOXING AND UNBOXING
	from java 5 -> autoboxing:just type the primitive value, and Java will convert it to the relevant wrapper class
					reverse conversion of wrapper class to primitive value is called unboxing	 

CONVERTING BETWEEN ARRAY AND LIST
	- a fixed-size list and is also known as a backed List because the array changes with it
		-> FixedList.java
	
	- an immutable copy of the original array	 
		-> ImutableList.java
		
	- If you will need to later add or remove elements, you'll still need to create an ArrayList using the constructor
	ArrayAndListConversions.java -> none of the options allows you to change the number of elements.
	
SORTING
	Collections.sort(numbers);
	

SET
	a Set isn't ordered
	cannot call set(index,value) or remove(index)
	* could not identify the index cos the way the set store values, 
	    not store index/element pair -> it store using buket/slot by using hashing algorithm
		bucket index = (hask(key) & capacity)
		load-factor 
	
	 add(value) -> if trying to add a duplicate value, the method returns false and does not add the value
	 
	 HashSet is the most common
	 TreeSet is used when sorting is important.
	 
Map	 
	 - method () -> Returns previous value or null if none
	 
	 
Calculating with Math APIs
	MIN() AND MAX()
	ROUND() -> if the first number of fractional part is .5 or higher, we round up.
	POW() 	->  exponents  
	double RANDOM()  returns a value greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1
