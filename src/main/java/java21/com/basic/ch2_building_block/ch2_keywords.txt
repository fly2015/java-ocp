CONSTRUCTORS
	 a constructor is a special method that matches the name of the class and has no return type
INSTANCE INITIALIZER

four code blocks:
a class definition, a method declaration, an inner block, and an instance initializer
-> Bird.java

balanced parentheses problem

ORDER OF INITIALIZATION
	Fields and instance initializer blocks are run in the order in which they appear in the file
	The constructor runs after all fields and instance initializer blocks have run.

Data Types
	float and double floating-point (decimal) 
	byte, short, int, and long without decimal points

	Each numeric type uses twice as many bits as the smaller similar type
	numeric types are signed in Java -> means that they reserve one of their bits to cover a negative range
	
	
	char is unsigned
	char can hold a higher positive numeric value than short
	char cannot hold any negative numbers
	
	scientific notation
	the numbers are stored as two numbers, a x 10^b
	
Writing Literals
	floating-point literals are assumed to be double

	decimal number system
	Octal (digits 0-7), which uses the number 0 as a prefix for example, 017
	Hexadecimal (digits 0-9 and letters A-F/a-f), which uses 0x or 0X as a prefix for example, 0xFF, 0xff, 0XFf.(case insensitive)
	Binary (digits 0-1), which uses the number 0 followed by b or B as a prefix for example, 0b10, 0B10

Literals and the Underscore Character
	add underscores anywhere except at the beginning of a literal, the end of a literal, right before a decimal point, or right after a decimal point

REFERENCE TYPES
	reference type refers to an object (an instance of a class)
		
IDENTIFYING IDENTIFIERS
	must begin with a letter, a $ symbol, or a _ symbol
	can include numbers but not start with them	
	Since Java 9, a single underscore _ is not allowed
	not same Java reserved word (native, strictfp, goto, const)
	
	const and goto aren't actually used in Java
	true/false/null are not actually reserved words, but literal values -> they cannot be used
	
	Java supports the Unicode character set, so there are thousands of characters that can start a legal Java identifier
	
Style: 
	camelCase	
	snake_case
	
DECLARING MULTIPLE VARIABLES
	to declare multiple variables in the same statement, they must share the same type declaration and not repeat it.

LOCAL VARIABLES
	local variable is a variable defined within a constructor, method, or initializer block
	Local variables do not have a default value and must be initialized before use

PASSING CONSTRUCTOR AND METHOD PARAMETERS	
	constructor parameters or method parameters are local variables that have been pre-initialized.
	
DEFINING INSTANCE AND CLASS VARIABLES	
	instance variable -> is a value defined within a specific instance of an object
	a class variable is one that is defined on the class level and shared among all instances of the class
	
	Default initialization values by type
		boolean  -> false
		byte, short, int, long  -> 0
		float, double -> 0.0
		char -> '\u0000' (NUL)
		object references -> null

VAR
	var from java 10 -> local variable type inference
	option of using the keyword var instead of the type for local variables under certain conditions.
	only use this feature for local variables
	can be used in for loops/try-catch/lamdas
	
Type Inference of var
	var is still a specific type defined at compile time
	for local variable type inference, the compiler looks only at the line with the declaration
	var cannot be initialized with a null value without a type, it can be assigned a null value after it is declared.

Review of var Rules
	var is used as a local variable in a constructor, method, or initializer block
	var cannot be used in constructor parameters, method parameters, instance variables, or class variables.
	var is always initialized on the same line (or statement) where it is declared
	The value of a var can change, but the type cannot
	var cannot be initialized with a null value without a type
	var is not permitted in a multiple-variable declaration
	var is a reserved type name but not a reserved word, meaning it can be used as an identifier 
	except as a class, interface, or enum name. 
	-> Var.class
	
SCOPE
	Local variables: In scope from declaration to end of block
	Instance variables: In scope from declaration until object eligible for garbage collection
	Class variables: In scope from declaration until program ends
	
Destroying Objects
	All Java objects are stored in your program memory�s heap.	

GARBAGE COLLECTION
	Garbage collection refers to the process of automatically
	freeing memory on the heap by deleting objects that are no
	longer reachable in your program
	
	eligible for garbage collection refers to an object�s state of no longer being accessible
	
	Calling System.gc()  is not guaranteed to run or do anything
	It merely suggests that the JVM kick off garbage collection
	
TRACING ELIGIBILITY
	The object no longer has any references pointing
	All references to the object have gone out of scope
	
FINALIZE()
	In a nutshell, the garbage collector would call the finalize() method once.	
	Just remember that finalize() can run zero or one times. It cannot run twice.
