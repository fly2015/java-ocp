In Java 11, the JRE is no longer available as a stand-alone

the method signature (method name and parameter types)

// a single-line comment
/* a multiline comment */
/** a javadoc comment */

comments aren't executable code

two classes in the same file. -> only one class is allowed public
Each file can contain only one public class.
The filename must match the class name, including case, and have a .java extension

access modifier
If a main() method isn't present in the class we name with the .java executable,
the process will throw an error and terminate

All command-line arguments are treated as String objects
String[] args
String args[]
String... args;

single-file source-code -> fully in memory

package
	import
	it begins with java or javax, this means it came with the JDK
	wildcard (*)
	Wildcards do not look at subdirectories
	
	naming conflict
	fully qualified class name
	
	package java.lang is special in that it does not need to be imported

compile	
	cannot use a wildcard to include subdirectories
	-cp, -classpath, --class-path

Ordering Elements in a Class
	Package -> import -> class -> field -> method

extra whitespace doesn't matter in Java syntax

Identify benefits of Java
	object oriented
	encapsulation
	platform independence
	robustness
	simplicity
	security
	multithreading
	backward compatibility

JDK contains the compiler and JVM launcher
