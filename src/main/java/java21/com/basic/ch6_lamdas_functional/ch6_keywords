Lambdas and Functional Interfaces
- Functional programming is a way of writing code more declaratively
You specify what you want to do rather than dealing with the state of objects. 
You focus more on expressions than loop

- Functional programming uses lambda expressions to write code
* A lambda expression is a block of code that gets passed around.
You can think of a lambda expression as an unnamed method
lambdas for short

LAMBDA SYNTAX
	- Lambdas work with interfaces that have only one abstract method. 	
	- Java relies on context when figuring out what lambda expressions mean
	- Since we are passing a lambda , Java tries to map our lambda to the interface
	
	- can omit braces when we have only a single statement.
	- parentheses are optional only when there is one parameter and it doesn’t have a type declared
	- doesn’t require you to type return or use a semicolon when no braces are used
	- s -> {} is a valid lambda
	
Introducing Functional Interfaces
	- Lambdas work with interfaces that have only one abstract method. These are called functional interfaces
	Single Abstract Method (SAM)
	@FunctionalInterface -> u don’t see the annotation doesn’t mean it’s not a functional interface.

PREDICATE -> 1 input return boolean
CONSUMER  -> 1 input void return
SUPPLIER  -> 0 input  1 return
COMPARATOR -> 2 input 1 return int
	The Comparator interface existed prior to lambdas being added to Java.
	Comparator in java.util.
	ints comparator uses natural sort order
	if the first number is bigger, it will return a positive number
	-> ComparatorDemo.java
	
Working with Variables in Lambdas
	parameter list, 
	local variables declared inside the lambda body	
	variables referenced from the lambda body
	
PARAMETER LIST
	- specifying the type of parameters is optional
	- var can be used in place of the specific type
	- lambda infers the types from the surrounding context
	* look for the type is in a method signature/ type of functional interfaces

LOCAL VARIABLES INSIDE THE LAMBDA BODY
	Java doesn’t let you create a local variable with the same name as one already declared in that scope
	-> LamdasDeclareVariableTrick.java
	
VARIABLES REFERENCED FROM THE LAMBDA BODY
	Access Rules:
	parameters and local variables are allowed to be referenced if they are effectively final.
	Instance variables (and class variables) are always allowed.

Calling APIs with Lambdas
	REMOVEIF()
	SORT()
	FOREACH()
	
USING FOREACH() WITH A MAP DIRECTLY	
	Use BiConsumer
	
	
*** Autoboxing works for collections not inferring predicates
