Method signature: method name and input parameters
ACCESS MODIFIERS
	private: the method can be called only from within the same class
	Default (Package-Private) Access
	protected  The protected modifier means the method can be called only from classes in the same package or subclasses
				**  it can only be accessed from a subclass reference or in the same package
	public

OPTIONAL SPECIFIERS
	static
	abstract
	final
	synchronized
	native
	strictfp
	
	- Java allows the optional specifiers to appear before the access modifier
	
RETURN TYPE	
	- void are permitted to have a return statement with no value returned or omit the return statement entirely
	
METHOD NAME
	- may only contain letters, numbers, $, or _
	- the first character is not allowed to be a number, and reserved words are not allowed.
	
OPTIONAL EXCEPTION LIST
	- You can list as many types of exceptions as you want in this clause separated by commas
	
	
	
Working with Varargs

	- A varargs parameter must be the last element in a method�s parameter list.
		-> 	you are allowed to have only one varargs parameter per method
	- pass in an array or list the elements of the array and let Java create it
	- can even omit the varargs values in the method call and Java will create an array of length zero
	- it is still possible to pass null explicitly
	- Accessing a varargs parameter is just like accessing an array. 

PRIVATE ACCESS/DEFAULT/PROTECTED/PUBLIC
	- Only code in the same class can call private methods or access private fields
	

Applying the static Keyword
	variable, method, class, import
	-  static methods don't require an instance of the class
		-> utility or helper methods that don't require any object state
		-> for state that is shared by all instances of a class
		
ACCESSING A STATIC VARIABLE OR METHOD	
	- You just put the class name before the method or variable and you are done	.
	***
	You can use an instance of the object to call a static method. 
	The compiler checks for the type of the reference and uses that instead of the object.
	The order that Java uses to choose the right overloaded method.
	-> StaticAccessViaObjectInstance.java (Dont be fooled)

STATIC VS. INSTANCE
	A static member cannot call an instance member without referencing an instance of the class
	
DOES EACH INSTANCE HAVE ITS OWN COPY OF THE CODE?
	- Each object has a copy of the instance variables
	- There is only one copy of the code for the instance methods
	- each call of an instance method (or any method) gets space on the stack for method parameters and local variables
	The same thing happens for static methods
	
	*** only data gets its own copy. There is no need to duplicate copies of the code itself.
	
STATIC INITIALIZATION	
	All static initializers run when the class is first used in the order they are defined..
	final variables arent allowed to be reassigned

TRY TO AVOID STATIC AND INSTANCE INITIALIZERS
	Use when when you need to initialize a static field and the code to do so requires more than one line
	
STATIC IMPORTS

Passing Data among Methods
	- Java is a pass-by-value language
	- Assigning a new primitive or reference to a parameter doesn't change the caller.
	- Calling methods on a reference to an object can affect the caller.

Overloading Methods
	- Method overloading occurs when methods have the same name but different method signatures, which means they differ by method parameters
	
	Everything other than the method name can vary for
	overloading methods. This means there can be different access
	modifiers, specifiers (like static), return types, and exception
	lists.
	You cannot have methods
	where the only difference is that one is an instance method and
	one is a static method.
	
	- The order that Java uses to choose the right overloaded method
	1. Exact match by type
	2. Larger primitive type
	3. Autoboxed type 
	4. Varargs

	can convert a primitive to larger primitive	or autobox it.
	can not convert a smaller primitive to an autobox version of the larger type. 
	if a variable is not a primitive, it is an Object

Encapsulating Data
	Encapsulation means only methods in the class with the variables can refer to the instance variables.
	(A state's of object should be changed by operation inside that object)
	- accessor method or a getter
	- a mutator method or a setter
	
	- remember that data (an instance variable) is private and getters/setters are public.
