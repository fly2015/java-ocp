    //automatic resource management - try with resources
    /*
     * Behind the scenes, the compiler replaces a try-with resources block with a try and finally block.
     *  We refer to this “hidden” finally block as an implicit finally block
        since it is created and used by the compiler automatically.
        You can still create a programmer-defined finally block
        when using a try-with-resources statement; just be aware
        that the implicit one will be called first.
        
        
        Remember that only a try-with-resources statement is
        permitted to omit both the catch and finally blocks. A
        traditional try statement must have either or both. You
        can easily distinguish between the two by the presence of
        parentheses, (), after the try keyword.
